This plugin (Greasemonkey userscript) allows you to edit formulas in
Gmail messages using a graphical formula editor.

The script uses [MathQuill] (http://mathquill.com/) as the formula
editor, and the [CodeCogs server] (https://latex.codecogs.com/) (with
their generous permission [\[1\]](#codecogs)) for generating the
images.

See the [Wiki]
(https://github.com/dominique-unruh/mathquill-for-gmail/wiki) for more
information.
