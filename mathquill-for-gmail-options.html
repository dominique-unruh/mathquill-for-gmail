    This is the configuration page
    for <a href="https://github.com/dominique-unruh/mathquill-for-gmail/blob/testing/README.md">MathQuill
    for Gmail</a>.  If you see this text, you need to install
    MathQuill for Gmail or, if you have done so, activate it in
    GreaseMonkey or TamperMonkey. If you have done that, too, and
    reloading this page does not help, check whether the current URL
    is listed in the "includes" of MathQuill for Gmail in the
    GreaseMonkey or TamperMonkey configuration.
